# How to Use the Application:

# Launch the Application: 
To use the IPL Score Prediction application, ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory. 
**Run the following command to launch the application**:
streamlit run app.py // or use the following url:**https://ml-projects-4hxnqpydx3c82rnbsydxgj.streamlit.app/** if it is not accessible it will be because the app will be temporarily deactivated by streamlit due to inactiveness.
**Input Match Details**: Once the application is running, you will see a web page with input fields. Follow these steps to fill in the details:

**Batting Team**: Choose the team currently batting from the dropdown list.
**Bowling Team**: Select the team currently bowling from the dropdown list.
**Overs**: Enter the number of overs played in the match so far.
**Runs**: Input the total runs scored by the batting team.
**Wickets**: Enter the number of wickets taken by the bowling team.
**Runs in Last 5 Overs**: Specify the runs scored by the batting team in the last 5 overs.
**Wickets in Last 5 Overs**: Provide the number of wickets taken by the bowling team in the last 5 overs.
**Get the Prediction**: After entering the match details, click on the "Predict" button. The application will process the information and display the predicted total score for the match.

**Technology Stack**:

# The IPL Score Prediction project incorporates the following technologies:

**Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
**Streamlit**: The web application framework used to build the user interface and handle user interactions.
**pickle**: A Python library used to load the pre-trained machine learning model.
**pandas**: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis, used for handling the input data.
**LinearRegression**: The machine learning algorithm used to create the prediction model.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE): Evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the prediction model.
#Use Case and Benefits:

The IPL Score Prediction application is designed for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and fans who want to get an estimate of the total score during an ongoing IPL match. While this application is not intended for actual betting or gambling, it offers the following benefits:

**Learning and Analysis**: The application provides a convenient way to explore the prediction process and understand the factors that contribute to the total score in an IPL match. It allows users to analyze match dynamics and gain insights into the potential outcome of the match.

**Educational Tool**: Aspiring data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts can use the IPL Score Prediction application as a learning tool to understand the application of machine learning in sports analytics. It showcases the potential of machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression, in predicting match scores based on historical data.

**Betting Firms and Gamblers**: Although this application is a demo and not intended for actual betting or gambling, it highlights the value that machine learning-based predictions can offer to betting firms and gamblers.
